6. Configure Environment Variables for Dynamic Passwords
To configure different passwords for different servers, you can set the METRICS_API_PASSWORD and RECEIVER_API_PASSWORD environment variables before running the application on each server.

For Linux:
export METRICS_API_PASSWORD="your_server_specific_password"
export RECEIVER_API_PASSWORD="receiver_specific_password"
./dist/sys-log-linux-x64


For Windows:
set METRICS_API_PASSWORD=your_server_specific_password
set RECEIVER_API_PASSWORD=receiver_specific_password
dist\sys-log-win-x64.exe
